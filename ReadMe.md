We have to print all the paths from root to leaf node.

We can go through the complete code. We have created 2 packages

1.) org.learn.Question: Under this question package, we will have Root2Leaf  class, which is responsible for traversing the tree till we encounter the leaf nodes and printing the complete path from root to leaf node.

2.) org.learn.Client: Under this package we have main function. We are using the Root2Leaf class to print all path from root to leaf nodes.
